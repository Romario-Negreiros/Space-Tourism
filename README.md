## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- SASS
- Javascript
- Mobile first
- BEM pattern

### What I practiced

- Mobile first workflow
- I hadn't use SASS in a while, this project helped me to remember the syntax and how to use SASS,
also how to learn how to create animations with it
- Structuring html content with semantic tags
- Writing readable (i hope) code with javascript, and make use of modules to divide functions reponsabilities.
